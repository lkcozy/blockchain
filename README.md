Blockchain is an immutable, distributed public ledger and peer-to-peer (P2P network).

- Block = all transactions within a certain time period
- Blockchain = links all blocks together

## Features of Blockchain

- `SHA256 Hash Function`: a one-way cryptographic function to generate a fixed size for any size of source text. The encrypted value cannot be decrypted back to the original text.
- `Public Key Cryptography`: creating a set of keys referred as Public key and Private key.
- `Distributed Leger`: a digital system in which transaction and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time.
- `Peer to Peer Network`: one in which two or more PCs shares files and access to devices such as printers without require a separate server computer.
- `Consensus Algorithm`: a process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed systems. `Proof-of-Work is the original consensus algorithm in a Blockchain network.`
- `Incentives for Validation`: giving a reward for validating the transactions and maintaining the Blockchain

## [Blockchain Type](#Using Blockchain for Trustworthy Mobile Contact Tracing)

The two common types are the Public Blockchain and the Private Blockchain.

- A public blockchain allows any node that has internet connection to access the blockchain by issuing either a write a read request. Some of the popular public blockchain available today are Bitcoins, Ethereum, Factom, Blockstream, and so on.
- A private blockchain allows nodes to issue similar requests but these nodes must be predefined and authorized.

## Getting Started(Docker)

Build images

```sh
docker-compose up --build
#or
docker-compose build dashboard
docker-compose up dev
```

Find out the IP address of running Docker engine:

```sh
docker-machine ip default

```
